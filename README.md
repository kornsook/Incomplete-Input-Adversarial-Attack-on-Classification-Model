This includes the weights for MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifiers; hence, please change the path variable in the code to your working space. Also, deep convolutional network, success rate and individual-image accuracy section consume too much time. Please be careful. However, all the results are already shown in the code, and you are not expected to run. Nonetheless, if you do want to run, please avoid those sections that we have mentioned.
